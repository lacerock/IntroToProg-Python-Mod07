# There’s an Error in My Pickle
## Introduction
In this module we learned about handling errors using a try and except blocks as well as serializing data, or pickling, into a binary file. The primary focus of this module was to learn via research, which is a pretty common way to learn in real life. Most coders still have to look up code or ideas about how to do the thing they imagine in their mind. Our goals were to research pickling and try/except error handling and create a script demonstrating both. Finally, we learned a bit about Markdown (the language used by GitHub) and how to create document/wiki-type pages on GitHub.

### Tutorials
I liked this tutorial https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/pickle-python-tutorial because of the way they highlighted, defined, and explained each element as it was used. (See Figure 1) I also liked that they included real examples of how it might be used or how it couldn’t be used. This gave me context for how to understand what the code is actually doing. (I’m a what/why learner).
